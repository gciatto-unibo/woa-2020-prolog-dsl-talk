\section{Motivation \& Context}
%===============================================================================

%\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\begin{frame}[c]{Context}

    \begin{block}{AI side}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item AI is shining, brighter than ever
            %
            \begin{itemize}
                \item mostly thanks to the advances in ML and sub-symbolic AI
            \end{itemize}

            \item[$\Rightarrow$] symbolic AI is gaining momentum because of XAI
            %
            \begin{itemize}
                \item[!] hybrid solution mixing logic \& data-driven AI are flourishing \ccite{xaisurvey-ia2020}
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{MAS side}
        The MAS community is eager for logic-based technologies \ccite{lptech4mas-jaamas2020}
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item to support agents' knowledge representation, reasoning, or execution

            \item or to prove MAS properties

            \item[!] despite few mature tech exist, and even fewer are actively maintained
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}
%\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

%\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\begin{frame}[c]{Motivation}

    \begin{alertblock}{The problem with logic-based technologies}
        There is technological barrier slowing
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item the adoption of logic programming (LP) as paradigm
            \item the exploitation of logic-based technologies
        \end{itemize}
        %
        while programming \emph{in the large}
    \end{alertblock}

    \vfill

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\overbrace{\text{mainstream programming languages}}^\text{\itshape e.g. Scala, Kotlin, Python, C\#}$ are blending several paradigms
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[e.g.] imperative, object-oriented (OOP), and functional programming (FP)
            \item except LP!
        \end{itemize}

        \vfill

        \item $\underbrace{\text{mainstream platforms}}_\text{\itshape e.g. JVM, .NET, JS, Python}$ are poorly interoperable with logic-based tech.
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

%\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\begin{frame}{Motivating example -- SWI-Prolog's FLI for Java}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Many Prolog implementors rely on Foreign Language Interfaces (FLI)
        %
        \begin{itemize}
            \item (mostly targetting Java, or C)
        \end{itemize}

        \vfill

        \item For instance, SWI-Prolog comes with a FLI for Java:
        %
        \inputminted{java}{code/SwiFliExample.java}

        \vfill

        \item[$\rightarrow$] No paradigm harmonization between Prolog and $\underbrace{\text{the hosting language}}_\text{\itshape i.e. Java}$
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

%\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\begin{frame}{Contribution of the paper}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Show that OOP, FP, and LP can be blended into a single language
    \item contribution 2
\end{itemize}
